# Reddit-comment-scrapper

A very simple script to scrap all the top-level comments of a Reddit post and save them to a file.

I have scrapped all the top-level comments (ie those without a parent) of a post asking about some Chuck Norris jokes and have saved them to a file.

You will need to make a Reddit account and follow some steps to be able to use PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for your own use.
