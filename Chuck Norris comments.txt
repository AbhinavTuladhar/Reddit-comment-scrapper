(2904) Due to extensive research done by the University of Pittsburgh, Chuck Norris has been confirmed as the hardest man known to man. The research is as follows:

Pocket-protected scientists built a wall made of iron and crashed Chuck Norris into it at 400 miles per hour, and Chuck Norris was unharmed. They then built a wall out of Chuck Norris and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and Chuck Norris came out fine. They then crashed Chuck Norris made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into Chuck Norris travelling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall made of metal into 400 miles an hour made of Chuck Norris, and the resulting explosion shifted earths orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles an hour. They shot Chuck Norris made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 10000 wayward planes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 10000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at Chuck Norris into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 Chuck Norrises per hour in front of a car made of wall travelling at miles per iron, and the result proved with out a doubt that Chuck Norris is the hardest man of all time, if not just the hardest man known to man.
